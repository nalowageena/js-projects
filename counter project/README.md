# COUNTER

    This is project number 2.
    It was pretty easy for me build this project compared to the first one.It took me about 3 hours to come out with the html and javascript files (i still have problems on styling but i will work on that) which is supprising since i took 3 days for the color flipper.So i think the more i work on these projects, the more i improve on my skills.
